Hello
This is a little Demo for TCmdBox
You can type commands while this text is written here !
Available commands :

 * help		: Short list for all commands
 * stop		: Stops me from reading this text...
 * pause		: Interrupts me
 * resume	: Continues at the last position pause was called...
 * start		: Restarts reading this text..
 * clear		: Clears the output buffer
 * clearhistory	: clears history buffer for previous input
 * exit		: Exits the program

A few details to TCmdBox...

To put TCmdBox into Inputmode use (example)

CmdBox.StartRead(clRed,clBlack,'>',clSilver,clBlack);

If you give a string parameter to StartRead, it will be displayed directly before the input and will follow it.

Input is received through an Event called OnInput.
Changes can be watched by the programm by OnInputChange.

To keep TCmdBox in Inputmode just call StartRead in OnInput again.

If you resize the application or use splitter in the middle you notice lines are wrapped, there is no fixed or limited line width.

Input is also saved in a history list with limited to HistoryMax entries including current input.

Output content by using:

CmdBox.Write('Text');

or

CmdBox.Writeln('Text...');

These calls are supposed to be Threadsafe !

You can use all font and background colors possible on the Operating System, for example

CmdBox.TextColor(clRed);
CmdBox.TextBackGround(clSilver);

or

CmdBox.TextColors(clRed,clSilver);

The background color of the last character in a line determines the background color of the rest of the line.

The component should be able to show correct UTF8 codes of any kind (up to the whole 21 bits), therefore:

€, ä, ö,ü

should be correctly written as Euro, Ae, Oe, Ue (the last three are german) if you have selected a UTF8 capable Font and LCL-Interface.

I hope you can use the component, if you find bugs or have suggestions contact me by email : kccmp@gmx.de
